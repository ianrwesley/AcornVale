					<h6 class="pg-label question">What is a Clara&nbsp;ID?</h6>
					<p class="answer">A Clara&nbsp;ID is the personal account you use to access Clara apps and services. It includes the email address and password you use to sign in, as well as all the contact, payment, and security details that you’ll use across Clara services.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h6 class="pg-label question">When do I use my Clara&nbsp;ID?</h6>
					<p class="answer">Any time you use a Clara app or make a purchase you will be asked to sign in with your Clara&nbsp;ID and password. Once signed in you’ll have access to the app and all the personal information in your account.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h6 class="pg-label question">How many Clara&nbsp;IDs do I need?</h6>
					<p class="answer">Just one. Use the same Clara&nbsp;ID everywhere you sign in to ensure that all your Clara apps and services work together seamlessly and you can access your personal content from any device.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h6 class="pg-label question">Can I share my Clara&nbsp;ID with someone else?</h6>
					<p class="answer">Your Clara&nbsp;ID should not be shared with anyone else. It provides access to personal information and patient’s health information. Sharing your Clara&nbsp;ID with someone else means you are giving them access to all your personal content and may lead to confusion over who actually owns the account. Additionally, you are the only person authorized to view any patient health information associated with your Clara&nbsp;ID. To share medication favorites, preferences, patient information, and more with someone else, try the <a href="">ClaraShare</a> feature.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h6 class="pg-label question">How can I keep my Clara&nbsp;ID secure?</h6>
